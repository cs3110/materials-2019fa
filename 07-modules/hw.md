   module system provide these features?
   
2. In the stack and queue implementations in the textbook, there are two
   implementations:  one in which some operations raise exceptions, and
   another in which some operations return options.  What are the
   trade-offs between those implementations?
   
3. Do the exercises named **complex synonym**, **complex encapsulation**, 
   and **fraction**.
 
4. For extra challenge, do **binary search tree dictionary**.
