# Homework 9

1. Go back to a data abstraction that you studied or implemented in a 
   previous course. For example, you could use this [Heaps handout from
   CS 2110][heaps] along with its [implementation code][heap-code].
   Figure out what the representation type, abstraction
   function, and representation invariants are.
   
2. Reflect on a time when you encountered a specification that you needed
   to implement, but you felt it was ambiguous.  Perhaps a programming
   assignment in this class or another class would serve as an example.   
   In retrospect, which of these factors (or maybe others) played a role?
   
   - The client didn't understand what they wanted you to implement, so the
     spec was poorly worded.
     
   - The spec was clear, but only after you came to understand the meaning
     of some piece of it better.
     
   - The client genuinely didn't care about some aspect of the implementation,
     so left it unspecified.
     
   What strategies might you follow in the future when you encounter
   ambiguous specs?
 
3. Do the exercises named **poly spec** and **poly impl**.
 
4. For extra challenge, do **function maps**.
