# Homework 25

1. Do these textbook exercises:  
   **promise and resolve**, **promise and resolve lwt**, and
   **timing challenges 1-4**.  If you have trouble downloading the
   file for the first exercise, try using your web browser's
   "open in a new tab" or "save link as" feature instead of just
   clicking on the file name.
   
2. For extra challenge, do **file monitor**.
