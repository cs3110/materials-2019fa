# Homework 5

1. Compare and constrast OCaml's `'a list` with Java's `LinkedList<E>`.
   Focus on the types, especially how you create and access values
   of each type.

2. Explain how Java references are similar to OCaml options.  Focus
   on how you would access the contents of an option vs. a reference,
   and what exceptions could be raised.
      
3. Do the exercises named **quadrant**, **depth**, **shape**, and **list max exn**.
 
4. For extra challenge, do **quadrant when**, **quadrant poly**, and **is_bst**.
   The last is especially tricky.
