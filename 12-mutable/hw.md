# Homework 12

1. Reflect on what it's been like to program functionally
   for the last seven weeks.  What have the challenges been? Have you
   come to think differently about mutable state, and if so, how?  Have
   the kinds of faults you find yourself debugging in programs changed,
   and if so, how?
   
2. Explain how it might be reasonable to think of a Java reference
   to an object of type `t` as being like the OCaml type `t ref option`.
   
3. Do the exercises named **mutable fields**, **addition assignment**,
   **physical equality**, **norm**, and **normalize**.
 
4. For extra challenge, do **doubly linked list**.
