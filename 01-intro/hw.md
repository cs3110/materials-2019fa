# Homework 1

*Note that if you read this homework directly from the Github web interface
in a browser, it will be nicely formatted as a web page instead of as plain
text Markdown.*

In 3110, **homeworks** are curated sets of exercises and tasks to help
you study effectively for the course.  You don't have to do it, and it
won't be collected or graded.  Nonetheless, we highly encourage you to
keep up with it.  You are allowed to collaborate fully with other students
on homework.  In fact, we encourage you to form study groups and work
on it together.

The questions below are designed to guide your initial explorations of
OCaml. Use sections 2.0 through 2.2.2 of the [3110 textbook][textbook],
as well as the [OCaml manual][manual], to help you.

[textbook]: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019fa/textbook
[manual]: http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html

1. For each of the following, investigate the OCaml manual to find out
what OCaml has, and explain in your own words how OCaml compares to
another language of your choice (perhaps Java or Python).  Make sure to
try out examples in the toplevel.
   
   - primitive types
   - operators
   - assertions
      
2. How do OCaml `if` expressions compare and contrast with `if` commands
in imperative languages, such as Java and Python?  And with ternary
operators? (If you're not already familiar with ternary operators in
those languages, now's a good time to look them up!)

3. Do the exercises named **values**, **if**, **assert**, and **more
fun** from the exercises section at the end of chapter 2 of the 3110
textbook.

4. When using the OCaml build system, what files get created, and where
are they are located? Experiment as necessary to find out. Note that
section 2.1 of the textbook will be helpful.

Note that solutions to textbook exercises can be found [in the solutions
repo][soln] in the `textbook` directory if you want to check your work.
There are also some brief answers to the other questions above in the
`hw` directory.
